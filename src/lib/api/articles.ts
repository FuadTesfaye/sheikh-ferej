    summary: "በአላህ ዘንድ ዋጋ ያለው ንጹሕ ልብ (ቀልቡን ሰሊም) እንዴት ይገነባል? የልብ በሽታዎች፣ ቂም፣ ምቀኝነት እና ከንቱ ምኞቶችን የማከሚያ ቁርኣናዊ መፍትሔዎች።",
    body: `### መግቢያ — የሰላማዊ ቀልብ ምንነት

አላህ (ሱብሃነሁ ወተዓላ) በቅዱስ ቁርኣን በሱረቱ አል-ሹዐራእ እንዲህ ይላል፦

> **يَوْمَ لَا يَنفَعُ مَالٌ وَلَا بَنُونَ ۝ إِلَّا مَنْ أَتَى اللَّهَ بِقَلْبٍ سَلِيمٍ**  
> *"ገንዘብም ልጆችም የማይጠቅሙበት ቀን፤ ወደ አላህ በሰላማዊ (ንጹሕ) ልብ የመጣ ሰው ብቻ ሲቀር።"* (አል-ሹዐራእ 88-89)

በዚህ አንቀጽ ላይ "ቀልቡን ሰሊም" ተብሎ የተገለጸው ልብ ከሽርክ፣ ከተንኮል፣ ከምቀኝነት፣ ከክፋትና ከማስመሰል የጸዳ እውነተኛ የኢማን ማረፊያ ነው።

---

### 1. የልብ በሽታዎች ምልክቶችና አደጋቸው

ልብ በሰውነታችን ውስጥ የሁሉም ስሜቶችና ድርጊቶች ንጉሥ ነው። ነቢዩ (ሰለላሁ ዐለይሂ ወሰለም) በአስተማሩት ሐዲስ፦  
*"በሰውነት ውስጥ አንዲት ቁራጭ ስጋ አለች፤ እርሷ ከተስተካከለች መላው አካል ይስተካከላል፣ እርሷ ከተበላሸች ግን መላው አካል ይበላሻል፤ እርሷም ልብ ናት።"* (ቡኻሪና ሙስሊም)

ዋና ዋናዎቹ የልብ ህመሞች የሚከተሉት ናቸው፦
- **ምቀኝነት (ሐሰድ)፦** የአላህን ችሮታ በሌሎች ላይ ማየት አለመፈለግና መጥፋቱን መመኘት።
- **ኩራትና እብሪት (ኪብር)፦** እውነትን መቃወምና ሰዎችን በንቀት መመልከት።
- **ይዩልኝ ይስሙልኝ (ሪያእ)፦** የአምልኮ ስራዎችን ለአላህ ብሎ ከማድረግ ይልቅ የሰዎችን ምስጋና መፈለግ።
- **ቂምና ጥላቻ፦** ወንድምንና እህትን በክፋት መያዝና ይቅርታን አለማድረግ።

---

### 2. ቀልብን የማከሚያና የማንጻት መንገዶች

ሰላማዊ ልብ በድንገት የሚገኝ ሳይሆን ቀጣይነት ባለው መንፈሳዊ ትግል (ሙጃሃዳህ) የሚገነባ ነው።

1. **ተውሂድን ማጥራት፦** ሁሉንም ጉዳይ ለአላህ ብቻ አሳልፎ መስጠት። ከአላህ ውጭ ምንም አይነት ፍራቻም ሆነ ከንቱ ተስፋ በልብ ውስጥ አለማኖር።
2. **አላህን አዘውትሮ ማውሳት (ዚክር)፦**  
   *«አላህን በማውሳት ልቦች ይረጋጋሉ!»* (አር-ረዕድ 28)። ቁርኣንን በተደብቡር (በማስተንተን) ማንበብና የጠዋት/ማታ አዝካሮችን ማዘውተር።
3. **ይቅር ባይነትን መላበስ፦** በሰዎች ላይ ያለብንን ቅሬታ ለአላህ ብለን ይቅር ማለት፤ አላህ የኛን ወንጀል ይቅር እንዲለን።
4. **ለሙስሊም ወንድሞች በጎ መመኘት (ነሲሓህ)፦** ለራስህ የምትወደውን በጎ ነገር ለሌሎችም መውደድ።

### ማጠቃለያ

በዚህ ምድራዊ ቆይታችን ትልቁ ስኬት ገንዘብ መቆለል ወይም ታዋቂነት ማትረፍ ሳይሆን፣ ከአላህ ጋር በሰላማዊና ንጹሕ ልብ መገናኘት ነው። አላህ ልባችንን በኢማንና በተውሂድ ያረጋጋልን!`,

### የሱረቱል ፈትህ ቁልፍ መልእክት

አላህ ለነቢዩ (ሰለላሁ ዐለይሂ ወሰለም) እና ለታማኝ ሰሃቦቻቸው የሰጠውን ታላቅ የተስፋ ቃል ሲያስታውስ፦

> **إِنَّا فَتَحْنَا لَكَ فَتْحًا مُّبِينًا**  
> *"እኛ ለአንተ ግልጽ የሆነን ድል ከፈትንልህ።"* (አል-ፈትህ 1)

ይህ አንቀጽ የወረደው በሁደይቢያህ ስምምነት ወቅት ነበር። በውጫዊ መልክ ለሙስሊሞች ከባድና አስቸጋሪ የመሰለው ሁኔታ፣ በአላህ ጥበብ ታላቅ የዲን መስፋፋትና የልቦች መከፈት ምክንያት ሆነ። 

እዚህ ላይ የምንማረው ትምህርት፦
- **የአላህ ፈተና ጀርባ ያለውን ጥበብ ማመን፦** አንዳንድ ጊዜ የምንጠላው ነገር ለኛ የተሻለ መልካምነት ይዞ ሊመጣ ይችላል።
- **የአላህ ጽናት (ሰኪናህ)፦** አላህ በምእመናን ልቦች ላይ መረጋጋትን ያወርዳል፤ በችግር ወቅት ጽናት የሚገኘው ከዚሁ ሰኪናህ ነው።

### የሱረቱል አሕቃፍ ተግሣጾች

ሱረቱል አሕቃፍ ደግሞ የሰው ልጅ ለወላጆቹ ሊኖረው የሚገባውን መልካም ውለታ እና ያለፈውን የዓድ ህዝቦች ታሪክ በማውሳት ትልቅ ማሳሰቢያ ይሰጣል፦

> **وَوَصَّيْنَا الْإِنسَانَ بِوَالِدَيْهِ إِحْسَانًا ۖ حَمَلَتْهُ أُمُّهُ كُرْهًا وَوَضَعَتْهُ كُرْهًا**  
> *"ሰውንም በወላጆቹ መልካም እንዲውል አዘዝነው፤ እናቱ በድካም አረገዘችው፣ በችግርም ወለደችው..."* (አል-አሕቃፍ 15)

የወላጆች ሐቅ በአላህ ዘንድ እጅግ የገዘፈ ነው። ለወላጆች በደግነት መቅረብ፣ መታዘዝ፣ በህይወትም ሆነ ከሞቱ በኋላ መልካም ዱዓእ ማድረግ የወጣቱ ትውልድ ቀዳሚ ግዴታ ነው።`,

*"ዱዓእ እርሱ ራሱ አምልኮት ነው።"* (ቲርሚዚ)

3. **ከወንጀልና ዝምድናን ከመቁረጥ መራቅ፦** ክፉ ነገርን ወይም በደልን አለመመኘት።
4. **እርግጠኝነትና አለመቸኮል፦** "ለመንኩ አልተመለሰልኝም" ብሎ ተስፋ ከመቁረጥ መቆጠብ፤ አላህ በተገቢው ጊዜና ወቅት መልስ እንደሚሰጥ ማመን።

### 2. አርአያ በመሆን ማስተማር (ቁድዋህ)
